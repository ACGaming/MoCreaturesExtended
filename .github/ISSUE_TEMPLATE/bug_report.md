**If you are making an issue regarding entity spawns, please attempt the following before reporting:**
1. Adjust the frequency values inside `MoCreatures.cfg`.
2. Utilize the Spawn Caps tweak in the [Universal Tweaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/universal-tweaks) mod to further increase entity spawn caps.
3. If you are playing with other mods that add entities and they are not spawning, you will most likely have to adjust their weights using a mod like [BiomeTweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/biometweaker) because of how vanilla's weight system works.
4. Be sure to mess around with the `World Gen Spawning Creatures` and `World Gen Spawning Water Creatures` config options inside `MoCSettings.cfg`.
