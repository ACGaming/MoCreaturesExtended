TerrainControl & CMS -> Things to know.

1. CMS will not work well when TC is generating a world using "BeforeGroups" biome mode.
2. MoCreatures will work with TC, it works better if you fillin the spawnTypes in each biome vs. using BiomeGroups from CMS.
3. MoCreatures will NOT spawn in a world that TC generated using "BeforeGroups" unless you fill in the spawnTypes in the Biome config.
4. MoCreatures WILL spawn in TC worlds that use Normal biome mode because it will attempt to fill in the DefaultGroups.
5. When TerrainControl loads if you use the biome more than once across multiple worlds it will only populate the biome spawn types once which is fine.

When using SpongeForge with CMS,  SpongeForge global, dimensionType and World settings for Spawns are completely ignored.
